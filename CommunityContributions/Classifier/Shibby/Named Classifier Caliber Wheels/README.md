# CS7.1 Caliber Conversions enhanced by Shibby



**Summary of changes from stock CS7.1 conversions**


Conversions with "a" (i.e CS7.1a) - resized bearing hole to "19.2" and caliber designations. WARNING - This is a press fit so it may or may not work for you depending on how you have dialed in the printer you are using and the bearings you are using. 

Conversions with "E" (i.e CS7.1E) - Stock bearing hole "19.6" just with caliber designations. Will behave as the standard CS7.1 conversions. 

These work for me and I make no guarantee they work for you.
